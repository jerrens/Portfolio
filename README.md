# Welcome to My Professional Portfolio!

This portfolio allows me to share a richer narrative of my professional journey.
Here, you'll find a selection of materials that highlight my skills, qualifications, and experience, offering a deeper perspective into my professional journey than a traditional resume.

**[Sample Projects](./SampleProjects.md):** Dive deeper into my capabilities by exploring a selection of projects that showcase my technical skills, problem-solving abilities, and approach to collaboration.

**[Skills](./Skills.md):** A list of skills that I have acquired throughout my professional career.

**[Continuing Education](./ContinuingEducation.md):** List of courses I plan to take over the next few weeks to expand my knowledge.
