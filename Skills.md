# Skills

Throughout my professional career, I've had the opportunity to tackle a wide range of projects, honing a diverse skillset that allows me to adapt and excel in various environments. This breadth of experience ensures I am someone who can leverage multiple skills to find the most effective solutions.

This section dives deeper into my specific skillsets, highlighting my proficiency in key areas.

***I hate to use the term "Expert" when ranking myself because I feel like that conveys that I have nothing else to learn which couldn't be further from the truth.
In all areas, I believe there is always room for growth and to expand your knowledge.***
