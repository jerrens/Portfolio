### With over 15+ years of experience in software development, I have a passion for analyzing customers' processes, identifying areas of improvement, and then breaking through paradigms to design and develop a streamlined solution. I have expertise in MEAN (MongoDB, Express.js, Angular, Node.js) stack development, several scripting languages, and process automation, and I enjoy mentoring and collaborating with cross-site and cross-functional teams to synchronize efforts into a synergy that helps teams reach their goals.

### At BlackBerry QNX, I developed, deployed, and maintained a web application to centralize storage, management, and analysis for test results using the MEAN stack. I also managed the infrastructure of the software test lab, including servers, tools, and automated test frameworks. I initiated and facilitated monthly cross-site meetings for lab stakeholders, and I was the go-to contact for troubleshooting and resolving problems. I mentored and helped to onboard and train new hires from co-ops to senior level developers, and I oversaw and regularly inspected the local site to ensure compliance with external audits.

## Projects

### BlackFish – Test Result Management Web Application	
BlackBerry/QNX/Research In Motion | November 2017 – March 2024

Developed an internal tool to centralize and manage test results from diverse frameworks and teams across the organization. The tool provided a REST API, enabling stakeholders to easily store, view, compare, filter, and investigate results. By empowering key stakeholders with valuable insights and monitoring capabilities, the tool significantly enhanced decision-making, triaging, and root-cause analysis, resulting in the successful storage and analysis of over 48.5 million tests during 2023, demonstrating its robustness and scalability in handling large volumes of data.

- Led the conception, design, development, deployment, and maintenance phases of the project.
- Managed all aspects of the infrastructure including:
MongoDB Replica Set Configuration	Production, Stage, and Test Servers (OS & Hardware)
Node.js Service hosting REST API	NGINX Service hosting front end
- Managed GitLab projects and branches, ensuring effective collaboration, version control, and project organization throughout development cycles.
- Configured ES Lint (static code analysis tool) for VS Code workspaces, enabling automated code quality checks and ensuring adherence to coding standards.
- Managed Epics, Stories, and Bug Issues in JIRA, ensuring accurate tracking, prioritizing, and resolution of tasks throughout the development lifecycle.
- Monitored performance metrics of client requests to identify system bottlenecks and areas to improve, including code optimization, collection indexing, and other enhancements, resulting in increased system efficiency and responsiveness.
- Collaborated with multiple teams across the organization to comprehend their distinct testing methodologies, then designed an adaptable schema to accommodate various test frameworks and ensuring future scalability.
  - Developed parsing scripts in JavaScript and Python tailored to each team’s specific procedures.
- Developed an extensive suite of unit, integration, API, and E2E test cases for the backend system using the Mocha + Chai frameworks, ensuring thorough coverage and resilience of the delivered RESTful interface.

### BlackBook – Hardware Reservation System Web Application	
BlackBerry/QNX/Research In Motion | 2023- March 2024

An internal tool designed to efficiently manage the sharing and utilization of hundreds of development boards among the test team and software developers, optimizing resource allocation and enabling continuous testing.
