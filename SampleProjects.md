## [ResumeTracker](https://github.com/jerrens/ResumeTracker) - Mongo Atlas

A Mongo Atlas App Service I developed allowing me to include a custom link on my resume and applications, which will direct potential employers to this electronic portfolio repo on GitHub and gain visibility into the resumes that drew additional interest.

Using an existing personal organization that I created in Mongo Atlas a few years ago when experimenting the free-tier of their cloud service, I added this new app service to build the desired functionality to track interest in my resume.
