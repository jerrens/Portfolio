There are many things that I've been interested in learning, but have not been able to work it into my schedule.  I plan to seize this opportunity over the next few weeks, in between all the other tasks involved with job searching, to check off a few of these curiosities and to add more tools to my belt.

Feedback is welcomed and appreciated!  If you're here exploring my portfolio and have a suggestion on a course, training or just a skill in general that would be beneficial, please open a GitHub Issue.
